# Posefect
In Pakistan, 70% of the people live in villages, making it physically and financially hard
for them to receive adequate help. A single physiotherapy session can cost around
500-3000 PKR, which can become kind of expensive if the patient needs more than one
session, and the constant travel to the therapist can cause distress as well. This
The project aims to create a platform where patients can perform exercises at their homes
and at their discretion. It is a desktop application that records the patient's movement through
computer vision and helps them perform exercises the right way through pose estimation. It
can help them exercise their neck muscles, wrists, and even fingers, all the while recording
the patient's progress and providing helpful feedback for the patients and their
physiotherapists.
